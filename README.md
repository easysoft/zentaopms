2. Why are we called ZenTao?
============================

In Chinese, Zen(禅) and Tao(道) are two words that have rich meanings in both religion and culture. ZenTao Project Management Software is originated in the cultural meanings of Zen and Tao, expecting to convey our understanding and thinking on management. Inspired by two books The Tao of Programming and The Zen of Programming, we name our software ZenTao.

3. Design philosophy of ZenTao Project Management Software
==========================================================

The main management theory of ZenTao Project Management Software is based on Scrum, an internationally popular agile management methodology. Results-oriented and operable, Scrum is very suitable for the fast sprint development of software development projects. However, Scrum only defines the core management framework. There are still many details and processes needing to be extended by the teams. On the basis of following the management methods of Scrum and with the consideration of the current domestic R&D status, ZenTao integrates the functions, such as bug management, test case management, release management and document management and completely covers the entire life cycle of software R&D projects. In ZenTao, the concepts of product, project and test are clearly defined. Product team, development team and testing team coordinate and check with each other while they are separated. With the interaction through requirements, tasks and bugs between the three teams, qualified products are ultimately made within the project.
