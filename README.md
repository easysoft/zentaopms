# Design Philosophy

The name ZenTao came from combining two Chinese characters, Zen(禅) and Tao(道), which have rich inspirations pertaining to culture and history. With its name referring to highly respected aspects of life, it’s only logical to convey their meaning in management by providing transparency, orderliness, and accessibility. 

ZenTao management concept is built on the 3 popular management methodologies: Scrum, Waterfall, and Kanban:

- The Scrum model built-in ZenTao is adaptable and flexible, which perfectly matches the rapid iterations of software development projects.
- The Waterfall model built-in ZenTao lays emphasis on stages division and strict process control, which is ideal for projects that are well defined in advance and with fewer changes.
- The Kanban model built-in ZenTao pays more attention to value flow and visualization, which is suitable for the team with a transparent process and efficient transmission of information.

ZenTao clearly defines the concepts of product, project, and QA to help the product owners, developers, and testers coordinate with each other while maintaining separate functionalities. Through stories, tasks, and bugs, the whole teams interact and track issues and improvements to ensure the delivery of quality products.

Besides, with ZenTao's feature-rich modules including data visualization, measurement, DevOps, Doc asset management, and automated testing, ZenTao offers flexible solutions to cover the entire process of software development, allows organizations to work efficiently and productivity, and helps them better control time, cost, and quality.
